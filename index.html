                            <br/>Down Under:

Budget Accommodation: Look for budget-friendly accommodation options such as hostels, guesthouses, or campsites. Websites like Hostelworld, Booking.com, and Airbnb often have affordable options.<br/>

Cook your Meals: Eating out can quickly add up, so consider cooking your meals whenever possible. Many hostels and budget accommodations provide kitchen facilities where you can prepare your own food. You can also shop at local supermarkets and markets for groceries.<br/>
<br/>
Public Transportation: Instead of renting a car or taking taxis, use public transportation like buses, trains, and trams. Consider purchasing multi-day or weekly passes for savings on transportation costs.<br/>
<br/>
Travel Off-Peak: Traveling during off-peak seasons can result in lower prices for accommodations, transportation, and attractions. Avoid traveling during school holidays and major events if you can.
<br/><br/>
Explore Free Attractions: Australia offers plenty of free or low-cost attractions, such as beaches, parks, hiking trails, and cultural sites. Take advantage of these to experience the country without breaking the bank.


<br/>
<br/>
Stay Flexible: Being flexible with your travel dates and destinations can help you take advantage of last-minute deals and discounts.<br/>
<br/>
Pack Wisely: Pack light to avoid excess baggage fees when flying and consider bringing essential items such as a reusable water bottle to save on purchasing drinks while out and about.

                            <br/>

Budget Accommodation: Look for budget-friendly accommodations such as hostels, guesthouses, or budget hotels. Consider options like Airbnb or Couchsurfing for even cheaper or free stays.<br/>

Stay Connected: Utilize online resources, travel forums, and social media to find deals, discounts, and insider tips from fellow travelers.<br/>

                            Traveling in Nepal on a budget can be an enriching experience. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your money while exploring this beautiful country:<br/>
                            <br/>

                            Budget Accommodation: Look for budget-friendly guesthouses, hostels, or homestays. Many places offer basic yet comfortable accommodations at affordable rates. Additionally, consider staying in local teahouses while trekking instead of pricier lodges.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                        
                            Local Transportation: Utilize local buses, microbuses, or shared jeeps for inter-city travel instead of private taxis or tourist buses. These options are much cheaper and give you a chance to experience local life.
                            <br/>
                            <BR/>
                            Eat Like a Local: Opt for local eateries, street food stalls, and markets to enjoy delicious and affordable Nepali cuisine. Dal bhat (rice and lentil soup), momos (dumplings), and thukpa (noodle soup) are popular and budget-friendly options.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Trekking Independently: If you plan to trek in Nepal, consider trekking independently or hiring a local guide directly instead of booking through a trekking agency. This can significantly reduce costs while still ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Flexible Travel Dates: Be flexible with your travel dates to take advantage of cheaper flights and accommodations. Avoid traveling during peak tourist seasons, such as the spring and autumn trekking seasons, when prices tend to be higher.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Permits and Entrance Fees: Research the necessary permits and entrance fees for national parks, heritage sites, and trekking routes in advance. Some permits can be obtained directly from local offices, saving you money on agency fees.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            Pack Light: Pack light to avoid extra baggage fees, especially if you plan to trek. Only bring essential items and consider renting gear like sleeping bags and trekking poles locally instead of buying them.

                <h3>Namche Bazar</h3>
                <p>Namche Bazaar is one of the most important stops along the Everest trekking Trail. Known as the capital of the Sherpa homeland, Namche is a bustling town carved on the side of a mountain. The town is built like an amphitheater overlooking the snow-clad Kongde Ri, Kusum Kanguru, Kantega, and Thamserku. Khumbila, the holy mountain of the Sherpas, rises right above and stands guard over the settlement.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
                    

                    This town is the economic center of the Khumbu Region and the biggest settlement of the Sherpas in Upper Khumbu. The town provides modern amenities to travelers as well as locals. There are shops, restaurants, cafes, luxury as well budget lodges, a bank, ATM, bakeries, spas, etc.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
                    People from the surrounding villages flock to Namche to buy and sell their products. Every Saturday, there's a weekly market where traders from as far as Tibet gather at the open-air market to trade their goods. From jewelry and handicraft items to yak cheese and organic farm produce, you will find an assortment of goods on sale.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
                    Since it lies at an altitude of 3,440 m meters and offers amenities that are not available at villages higher up, trekkers make it a point to spend their first acclimatization or rest days at Namche Bazaar.

            <h3>Tilicho Lake</h3>
            <p>Tilicho Lake is a spectacular glacial lake in the Annapurna Region of the Nepal Himalayas. It is a trekking as well as a pilgrimage destination. Most trekkers visit this lake as a side trip while trekking along the Annapurna Circuit Route or the Thorung La Pass. Surrounded by tall snow-covered mountains and frozen glaciers, Tilicho is one of the world's most beautiful high-altitude lakes. It was Nepal's highest lake, but after the discovery of Kanjin Sara Lake in Chame, at an elevation of 5002 meters, in 2019, Tilicho slid to the second spot.<br/>
                <br/>

                Located in the Manang district, Tilicho Lake is a must-visit destination for trekkers walking along the Annapurna Circuit Trail. The lake also has a deep spiritual value. For Hindus, Tilicho is the sacred lake Kag Bhusundi which is mentioned in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Buddhists revere this lake as the Buddhist saint Milarepa is said to have meditated on the banks of Tilicho</p>

        <h3>Swayambhu Stupa</h3>
        <p>Swayambhu is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal. According to the Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī, it was founded by the great-grandfather of King Mānadeva (464–505 CE), King Vṛsadeva, about the beginning of the fifth century CE. This seems to be confirmed by a damaged stone inscription found at the site, which indicates that King Vrsadeva ordered work done in 640 CE.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            However, Emperor Ashoka is said to have visited the site in the third century BCE and built a temple on the hill which was later destroyed.<br/>
            <br/>
            
            Although the site is considered Buddhist, the place is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. Numerous Hindu monarch followers are known to have paid their homage to the temple, including Pratap Malla, the powerful king of Kathmandu, who is responsible for the construction of the eastern stairway in the seventeenth century.<br/>

    <h3>Dhorpatan hunting reserve</h3>
        
        <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only hunting reserve in Nepal. Established in 1987 it covers an area of 1,325 km2 (512 sq mi) in the Dhaulagiri Himal of western Nepal in the Eastern Rukum, Myagdi and Baglung Districts. In elevation, it ranges from 2,850 to 5,500 m (9,350 to 18,040 ft).<br/>
    <br/>
    The landscape consists of forests, marshland (called ḍhor), and flat meadows (called pāṭan). The higher elevations remain snow-covered throughout the year. 58 vascular plants have been recorded in the reserve. Flowering plants include 36 endemic species. 18 mammal species include snow leopard, musk deer, red panda, and blue sheep. 137 bird species include koklass pheasant, cheer pheasant, and impeyan pheasant; and two reptile species also occur.
